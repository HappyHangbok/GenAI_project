Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like a human and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. With the advancement of technology, artificial intelligence has evolved significantly, touching various domains like healthcare, finance, and automotive, thereby reshaping the future. Machine learning, a subset of AI, empowers systems with the capability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes neural networks to analyze various factors of data. Natural language processing enables machines to understand and respond to human language, enhancing user interaction and experience.
